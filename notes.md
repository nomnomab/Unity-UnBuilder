The main goal of this project is to make a better version of my prior build->project conversion.

## Goals:
- Determine Unity version automatically.
- Extract usable scripts.
- Extract usable assets.
- Fix guids across the project so prefabs and other references function normally.
- Make most of the process automatic and in this CLI tool itself.
